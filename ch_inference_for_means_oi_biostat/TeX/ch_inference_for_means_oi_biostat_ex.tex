\eoce{\qt{Blue-green eggshells\label{blue_eggs_food}} It is hypothesized that the blue-green color of the eggshells of many avian species represents an informational signal as to the health of the female that laid the eggs. To investigate this hypothesis, researchers conducted a study in which birds assigned to the treatment group were provided with supplementary food before and during laying; they predict that if eggshell coloration is related to female health at laying, females given supplementary food will lay more intensely blue-green eggs than control females. Nests were paired according to when nest construction began, and the study examined 16 nest pairs.

\begin{parts}	
\item The blue-green chroma (BGC) of eggs was measured on the day of laying; BGC refers to the proportion of total reflectance that is in the blue-green region of the spectrum, with a higher value representing a deeper blue-green color. In the food supplemented group, BGC chroma had $\overline{x} = 0.594$ and $s = 0.010$; in the control group, BGC chroma had $\overline{x} = 0.586$ and $s = 0.009$. A paired $t$-test resulted in $t = 2.28$ and $p = 0.038$. Interpret the results in the context of the data.
\item In general, healthier birds are also known to lay heavier eggs. Egg mass was also measured for both groups. In the food supplemented group, egg mass had $\overline{x} = 1.70$ grams and $s = 0.11$ grams; in the control group, egg mass had $\overline{x} = 0.586$ grams and $s = 0.009$ grams.

One strategy being explored by researchers involves developing chickens that are genetically resistant to infection. In 2011, a team of investigators reported in \textit{Science} that they had successfully generated transgenic chickens that are resistant to the virus. As a part of assessing whether the genetic modification might be hazardous to the health of the chicks, hatch weights between transgenic chicks and non-transgenic chicks were collected. Does the following data suggest that there is a difference in hatch weights between transgenic and non-transgenic chickens?

While placebo treatment can influence subjective symptoms, it is typically believed that patient response to placebo requires concealment or deception; in other words, a patient must believe that they are receiving an effective treatment in order to experience the benefits of being treated with an inert substance. Researchers recruited patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to test whether placebo responses are neutralized by awareness that the treatment is a placebo.

Patients were randomly assigned to either the treatment arm or control arm. Those in the treatment arm were given placebo pills, which were described as "something like sugar pills, which have been shown in rigorous clinical testing to produce significant mind-body self-healing processes". Those in the control arm did not receive treatment. At the end of the study, all participants answered a questionnaire called the IBS Global Improvement Scale (IBS-GIS) which measures whether IBS symptoms have improved; higher scores are indicative of more improvement.

At the end of the study, the 37 participants in the open placebo group had IBS-GIS scores with $\overline{x} = 5.0$ and $s = 1.5$, while the 43 participants in the no treatment group had IBS-GIS scores with $\overline{x} = 3.9$ and $s = 1.3$. 

Based on an analysis of the data, summarize whether the study demonstrates evidence that placebos administered without deception may be an effective treatment for IBS.

\eoce{\qt{True / False: ANOVA, Part I\label{tf_anova_1}} Determine if the following statements 
are true or false in ANOVA, and explain your reasoning for statements you identify as false.
\begin{parts}
\item As the number of groups increases, the modified significance level for pairwise tests 
increases as well.
\item As the total sample size increases, the degrees of freedom for the residuals increases as 
well.
\item The constant variance condition can be somewhat relaxed when the sample sizes are 
relatively consistent across groups.
\item The independence assumption can be relaxed when the total sample size is large.

\eoce{\qt{Child care hours\label{child_care_hours}} The China Health and Nutrition Survey aims 
to examine the effects of the health, nutrition, and family planning policies and programs 
implemented by national and local governments.\footfullcite{data:china} It, for example, 
collects information on number of hours Chinese parents spend taking care of their children 
under age 6. The side-by-side box plots below show the distribution of this variable by 
educational attainment of the parent. Also provided below is the ANOVA output for comparing 
average hours across educational attainment categories.

\eoce{\qt{Prison isolation experiment, Part II\label{prison_isolation_anova}} 
Exercise~\ref{prison_isolation_T} introduced an experiment that was conducted with the goal of 
identifying a treatment that reduces subjects' psychopathic deviant T scores, where this score 
measures a person's need for control or his rebellion against control. In 
Exercise~\ref{prison_isolation_T} you evaluated the success of each treatment individually. An 
alternative analysis involves comparing the success of treatments. The relevant ANOVA output is 
given below.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}

 & Df & Sum Sq & Mean Sq & F value & Pr($>$F) \\

\item What is the conclusion of the test? Use a 5\% significance level.

in part~(b), recheck your answer.

\eoce{\qt{True / False: ANOVA, Part II\label{tf_anova_2}} Determine if the following statements 
are true or false, and explain your reasoning for statements you identify as false.

If the null hypothesis that the means of four groups are all the same is rejected using ANOVA 
at a 5\% significance level, then ...
\begin{parts}
\item we can then conclude that all the means are different from one another.
\item the standardized variability between groups is higher than the standardized variability 
within groups.
\item the pairwise analysis will identify at least one pair of means that are significantly 
different.
\item the appropriate $\alpha$ to be used in pairwise comparisons is 0.05 / 4 = 0.0125 since 
there are four groups.
