\eoce{\qt{True or false\label{tf_prob_definitions}} Determine if the statements 
below are true or false, and explain your reasoning.
\begin{parts}
\item Assume that a couple has an equal chance of having a boy or a girl. If a couple's previous three children have all been boys, then the chance that their next child is a boy is somewhat less than 50\%.
\item Drawing a face card (jack, queen, or king) and drawing a red card from a 
full deck of playing cards are mutually exclusive events.
\item Drawing a face card and drawing an ace from a full deck of playing cards 
are mutually exclusive events.

\eoce{\qt{Colorblindness\label{colorblindness}} Red-green colorblindness is a commonly inherited form of colorblindness; the gene involved is transmitted on the X chromosome in a recessive manner. If a male inherits an affected X chromosome, he is necessarily colorblind (genotype $X^{-}Y$). However, a female can only be colorblind if she inherits two defective copies (genotype $X^{-}X^{-}$); heterozygous females are not colorblind. Suppose that a couple consists of a genotype $X^{+}Y$ male and a genotype $X^{+}X^{-}$ female.
\begin{parts}
\item What is the probability of the couple producing a colorblind male?
\item True or false: Among the couple's offspring, colorblindness and female sex are mutually exclusive events.

\eoce{\qt{Diabetes and hypertension\label{diabetes_hypertension}} Diabetes and hypertension are two of the most common diseases in Western, industrialized nations. In the United States, approximately 9\% of the population have diabetes, while about 30\% of adults have high blood pressure. The two diseases frequently occur together: an estimated 6\% of the population have both diabetes and hypertension.
\begin{parts}
\item Are having diabetes and having hypertension disjoint?
\item Draw a Venn diagram summarizing the variables and their associated probabilities.
\item Let $A$ represent the event of having diabetes, and $B$ the event of having hypertension. Calculate $P(A \text{ or } B)$.

\item In a hypothetical population of 100,000, how many individuals would be expected to test positive? Of those who test positive, how many would be true positives? Calculate the PPV of IRT.
\item In order to account for lab error or physiological fluctuations in IRT levels, infants who tested positive on the initial IRT screen are asked to return for another IRT screen at a later time, usually two weeks after the first test. This is referred to as an IRT/IRT screening strategy. Calculate the PPV of IRT/IRT.

\eoce{\qt{Mumps\label{mumps}} Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection that most often occurs in children, but can affect adults, particularly if they are living in shared living spaces such as college dormitories. It is most recognizable by the swelling of salivary glands at the side of the face under the ears, but earlier symptoms include headaches, fever, and joint pain. Suppose a college student at a university presents to a physician with symptoms of headaches, fever, and joint pain. Let $A$ = \{headaches, fever, and joint pain\}, and suppose that the possible disease state of the patient can be partitioned into: $B_1$ = normal, $B_2$ = common cold, $B_3$ = mumps. From clinical experience, the physician estimates $P(A|B_i)$: $P(A|B_1) = 0.001$, $P(A|B_2) = 0.70$, $P(A|B_3) = 0.95$. The physician, aware that some students have contracted the mumps, then estimates that for students at this university, $P(B_1) = 0.95$, $P(B_2) = 0.025$, and $P(B_3) = 0.025$. Given the previous symptoms, which of the disease states is most likely?}{}

\eoce{\qt{IQ testing\label{iq_testing}} A psychologist conducts a study on intelligence in which participants are asked to take an IQ test consisting of $n$ questions, each with $m$ choices.
	\begin{parts}
		\item One thing the psychologist must be careful about when analyzing the results is accounting for lucky guesses. Suppose that for a given question a particular participant either knows the answer or guesses. The participant knows the correct answer with probability $p$, and does not know the answer (and therefore will have to guess) with probability $1-p$. The participant guesses completely randomly. What is the conditional probability that the participant knew the answer to a question, given that they answered it correctly?
		\item About 1 in 1,100 people have IQs over 150. If a subject receives a score of greater than some specified amount, they are considered by the psychologist to have an IQ over 150. But the psychologist's test is not perfect. Although all individuals with IQ over 150 will definitely receive such a score, individuals with IQs less than 150 can also receive such scores about 0.1\% of the time due to lucky guessing. Given that a subject in the study is labeled as having an IQ over 150, what is the probability that they actually have an IQ below 150?

\eoce{\qt{Breast cancer and age\label{breast_cancer_age}} The strongest risk factor for breast cancer is age; as a woman gets older, her risk of developing breast cancer increases. The following table shows the average percentage of American women in each age group who develop breast cancer, according to statistics from the National Cancer Institute. For example, approximately 3.56\% of women in their 60's get breast cancer.

\eoce{\qt{Prostate-specific antigen\label{psa_test}} Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by the cells of the prostate gland. Blood PSA level is often elevated in men with prostate cancer, but a number of benign (not cancerous) conditions can also cause a man's PSA level to rise. The PSA test for prostate cancer is a laboratory test that measures PSA levels from a blood sample. The test measures the amount of PSA in ng/ml (nanograms per milliliter of blood).
	
	The sensitivity and specificity of the PSA test depend on the cutoff value used to label a PSA level as abnormally high. In the last decade, 4.0 ng/ml has been considered the upper limit of normal, and values 4.1 and higher were used to classify a PSA test as positive.  Using this value, the sensitivity of the PSA test is 20\% and the specificity is 94\%.
	
	The likelihood that a man has undetected prostate cancer depends on his age.  This likelihood is also called the prevalence of undetected cancer in the male population.  The following table shows the prevalence of undetected prostate cancer by age group.

\eoce{\qt{Colorblindness\label{colorblindness_follow_up}} The most common form of colorblindness is a recessive, sex-linked hereditary condition caused by a defect on the X chromosome. Females are XX, while males are XY. Individuals inherit one chromosome from each parent, with equal probability; for example, an individual has a 50\% chance of inheriting their father's X chromosome, and a 50\% chance of inheriting their father's Y chromosome. If a male has an X chromosome with the defect, he is colorblind. However, a female with only one defective X chromosome will not be colorblind. Thus, colorblindness is more common in males than females; 7\% of males are colorblind but only 0.5\% of females are colorblind.
	\begin{parts}
	\item Assume that the X chromosome with the wild-type allele is $X^{+}$ and the one with the disease allele is $X^{-}$. What is the expected frequency of each possible female genotype: $X^{+}X^{+}$, $X^{+}X^{-}$, and $X^{-}X^{-}$? What is the expected frequency of each possible male genotype: $X^{+}Y$ and $X^{-}Y$?
	
	\item Suppose that two parents are not colorblind. What is the probability that they have a colorblind child?

\eoce{\qt{Rapid feathering\label{rapid_feathering}} Sex linkage refers to the inheritance pattern that results from a mutation occurring on a gene located on a sex chromosome. A classic example of a sex-linked trait in humans is red-green color blindness; females can only be red-green colorblind if they have two copies of the mutation (one on each X chromosome), while a single copy of the mutation is sufficient to confer colorblindness in males (since males only have one X chromosome).  
	
	In birds, females are the heterogametic sex (with sex chromosomes ZW) and males are the homogametic sex (with sex chromosomes ZZ). A commonly known sex-linked trait in domestic chickens is the rapid feathering trait, which is carried on the Z chromosome. Chickens with the rapid feathering trait grow feathers at a faster rate; this difference is especially pronounced within the first few days from hatching. The wild-type allele $K^-$ is dominant to the mutant alelle $K^+$; presence of the $K^-$ allele produces slow feathering. Females can be either genotype $Z^{K^+}W$ or $Z^{K^-}W$. Males can be either heterozygous ($Z^{K^+}Z^{K^-}$), homozygous for slow feathering ($Z^{K^-}Z^{K^-}$), or homozygous for rapid feathering ($Z^{K^+}Z^{K^+}$).
	
	In a population of chickens, 9\% of males are rapid feathering and 16\% of females are rapid feathering. Suppose that slow feathering chickens are mated. What is the probability that out of their 12 offspring, at least two are rapid feathering?

\eoce{\qt{Genetics of Australian cattle dogs\label{acd_genetics}} Australian cattle dogs are known to have a high prevalence of congenital deafness. Deafness in both ears is referred to as bilateral deafness, while deafness in one ear is referred to as unilateral deafness.

Deafness in dogs is associated with the white spotting gene $S$ that controls the expression of coat and eye pigmentation. The dominant allele $S$ produces solid color, while the three recessive alleles contribute to increasing amounts of white in coat pigmentation: Irish spotting ($s^i$), piebald ($s^p$), and extreme white piebald ($s^w$). The $s^p$ and $s^w$ alleles are responsible for the distinctive Australian cattle dog coat pattern of white hair evenly speckled throughout either a predominantly red or black coat. The dogs are born with white coats, and the speckled pattern develops as they age. 

While all Australian cattle dogs have some combination of the $s^p$ and $s^w$ alleles, the gene displays incomplete penetrance such that individuals show some variation in phenotype despite having the same genotype. Individuals with low penetrance of the alleles tend to have additional patterns on their coat, such as a dark "mask" around one or both eyes (in other words, a unilateral mask or a bilateral mask). High penetrance of the piebald alleles is associated with deafness.

Suppose that 40\% of Australian cattle dogs have black coats; these individuals are commonly referred to as "Blue Heelers" as opposed to "Red Heelers". Among Blue Heelers, 35\% of individuals have bilateral masks and 25\% have unilateral masks. About 50\% of Red Heelers exhibit no eye masking and 10\% have bilateral masks. 

Let $M$ represent the event that an Australian cattle dog has a facial mask, where $M_2$ represents a bilateral mask, $M_1$ represents a unilateral mask, and $M_0$ indicates lack of a mask.

	\begin{parts}
		
		\item Calculate the probability an Australian cattle dog has a facial mask and a black coat.
		
		\item Calculate the prevalence of bilateral masks in Australian cattle dogs.
		
		\item Among Australian cattle dogs with bilateral facial masks, what is the probability of being a Red Heeler?
		
		\item Unilateral deafness occurs in Red Heelers with probability 0.15, in both dogs that either lack facial masking or exhibit a unilateral mask; for both unmasked and unilaterally masked Red Heelers, 60\% of dogs are not deaf. The overall prevalence of bilaterally masked Australian cattle dogs with bilateral deafness and red coats is 1.2\% and the overall prevalence of bilaterally masked Australian cattle dogs with unilateral deafness and red coats is 4.5\%; these prevalences are the same for Australian cattle dogs with black coats. Among Blue Heelers with either no facial masking or a unilateral mask, the probability of unilateral deafness is 0.05 and the probability of bilateral deafness is 0.01. 
		
		Let $D$ represent the event that an Australian cattle dog is deaf (i.e., deaf in at least one ear), where $D_2$ represents bilateral deafness and $D_1$ represents unilateral deafness. 
		
		\begin{subparts}
			
			\item What is the probability that an Australian cattle dog has a bilateral mask, no hearing deficits, and a red coat?
			
			\item Calculate the proportion of bilaterally masked Blue Heelers without hearing deficits.
			
			\item Compare the prevalence of deafness between Red Heelers and Blue Heelers.
			
			\item If a dog is known to have no hearing deficits, what is the probability it is a Blue Heeler?
