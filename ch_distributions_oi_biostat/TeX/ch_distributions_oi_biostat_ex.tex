\eoce{\qt{Donating blood\label{abo_blood}}
When patients receive blood transfusions, it is critical that the blood type of the donor is compatible with the patients, or else an immune system response will be triggered. For example, a patient with Type O- blood can only receive Type O- blood, but a patient with Type O+ blood can receive either Type O+ or Type O-. Furthermore, if a blood donor and recipient are of the same ethnic background, the chance of an adverse reaction may be reduced. According to a 10-year donor database, 0.37 of white, non-Hispanic donors are O+ and 0.08 are O-. 
\begin{parts}
\item Consider a random sample of 15 white, non-Hispanic donors. Calculate the expected value of individuals who could be a donor to a patient with Type O+ blood. With what standard deviation?
\item What is the probability that 3 or more of the people in this sample could donate blood to a patient with Type O- blood?

	various complications. If both parents are carriers of the disease, then a 
	child has a 25\% chance of having the disease, 50\% chance of being a 
	carrier, and 25\% chance of neither having the disease nor being a carrier. 
	If two parents who are carriers of the disease have 3 children, what is the

	Approximately 12,500 stocks of \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} flies are kept at The Bloomington \textit{Drosophila} Stock Center for research purposes. A 2006 study examined how many stocks were infected with Wolbachia, an intracellular microbe that can manipulate host reproduction for its own benefit. About 30\% of stocks were identified as infected. Researchers working with infected stocks should be cautious of the potential confounding effects that Wolbachia infection may have on experiments. Consider a random sample of 250 stocks.

	kids. 
	\begin{parts}
		\item Use the binomial model to calculate the probability that two of them 
		will be boys.

		have 8 kids will have 3 boys, briefly describe why the approach from part (b) 
		would be more tedious than the approach from part (a).

	When she has had practically no sleep, she scores very well about 30\% of the time. When she has had relatively little sleep, she scores very well 40\% of the time. When she has had a reasonable amount of sleep, she scores very well 42\% of the time.

Osteosarcoma is a relatively rare type of bone cancer.  It occurs most often in young adults, age 10 - 19; it is diagnosed in approximately 8 per 1,000,000 individuals per year in that age group. In New York City (including all five boroughs), the number of young adults in this age range is approximately 1,400,000.

\item Suppose that in a given year, 10 cases of osteosarcoma were observed in NYC, with all 10 cases occurring among young adults living in Brooklyn. An official from the NYC Public Health Department claims that the probability of this event (that is, the probability of 10 or more cases being observed, and all of them occurring in Brooklyn) is what was calculated in part c). Is the official correct? Explain your answer. You may assume that your answer to part c) is correct. This question can be answered without doing any calculations.

In 2014-2015, the population of Essex County, MA, was approximately 769,000, of whom 73\% are non-Hispanic white. Assume that incidence rate of opioid deaths in Essex County is the same as the 2013 national rate. \textit{Note: this problem is best done using statistical software.}
